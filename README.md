## 🎯 About the Game

**Simon Says** is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to repeat increasingly longer sequences of colored lights and sounds. This web-based version recreates the nostalgic 1978 Milton Bradley game with a modern, sleek interface.

Test your memory, concentration, and pattern recognition skills as you try to beat your high score! Each level adds a new color to the sequence, making it progressively more challenging.
